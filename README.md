# reviewApp

This is a simple demo app to demonstrate the dowload of data and using of pagination with recycler view.

Technologies in use:
- Retrofit
- RxJava
- Robolectric (running integration test)

Offline mode support:

To support offline mode, I enabled network caching. Unfortunately, the server doesn't support it, so itâ€™s pretty hacky and dangerous.
Either server should give support, or would need to find other solutions like storing in db. (Room)

Downloading Pagination:

Made my own simple class to perform download of data with retrofit and use pagination. In bigger projects would be nice to consider using Paging Library

Filtering:

Since filtering with Pagination could be confusing to user, (Need to disable pagination, and wont see al the data) filtering is not implemented.

Posting New Review:

Given that user is authenticated, the body can only contain the provided fields. (Title, comment, travel type)
Response can be simple, a status code review_id should be returned and optional error message.
Would consider adding the number of reviews, to see if new reviews popped up.
Also, might be a good idea to return the new review object. In case we would consider using database.

Improvements:

- Better error handling. Adding error handling to send review page
- Adding a retry button in case of failure
- Fix orientation change
- Better use of loading indicator
